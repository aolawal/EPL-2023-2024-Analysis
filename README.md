### EPL Teams that scored & conceded most goals in 2023/2024 Season

#### Top 5 Teams with Highest Number of Goals out of 38 Matches played by All teams in EPL:
The analysis shows that Top 3 teams had the highest number of goals, but the remaining ranking reveals that the numbers of goals scored does not necessarily determines your position on EPL table as Newcastle and Chelsea Football club scored a lot of goals, but they did not make the Top 5 on the table.

#### EPL Teams with Highest Number of Goals Conceded out of 38 Matches played:
- Logically the more goals a team concede the higher their chances of being at the bottom of the table and the result followed this pattern
- However, Westham and Bournemouth conceded a lot of goals in their matches and they still manage to be ranked no. 9 amd 12 respectively on EPL table as  they were able to score back against their opponents and get away with some decent results in their matches.

### Analysis of the Top 5 Teams Performance
- Arsenal and Man City had equal number of wins, but Man. City was able to win the race because they lost fewer matches when compared to Arsenal.
- Man. City was able to get away with a draw in some of the matches they were unable to win.
- On the other hand, Liverpool which occupied no.3 spot on EPL table in 2023/2024 season had the highest number of draws and the lowest number of loss after Man City than any team in Top 5. Probably they might have won the league or occupy the 2nd spot if they had converted some of their draws to a win.
